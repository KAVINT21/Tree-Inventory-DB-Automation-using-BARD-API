# Talking to a Database(DATABASE AUTOMATION)

# Description:

TreeInventory_DB is an end-to-end Language Model (LLM) project built on Google 
Palm and Langchain, designed to interact with a MySQL database. The system 
facilitates natural language interactions, allowing users to pose questions about 
tree details stored in the TreeInventory_DB MySQL database. The system generates 
SQL queries based on the user's questions and executes them on the database, 
providing accurate and contextual answers.

# Key Features:

# 1. Natural Language Interaction:
The system is equipped with a natural language processing capability, enabling 
users, particularly store managers, to ask questions in plain language. The 
system interprets these questions and converts them into SQL queries for 
meaningful interactions with the MySQL database.

# 2. Google Palm LLM:
The project leverages the power of Google Palm Language Model (LLM) for 
natural language understanding and query generation. Google Palm's advanced 
language capabilities contribute to the system's ability to comprehend and 
respond intelligently to a diverse range of user queries.

# 3. Streamlit for UI:
The user interface is developed using Streamlit, a Python library for creating 
interactive web applications. Store managers can use the UI to ask questions in 
natural language, making the interaction intuitive and accessible.

# 4. Langchain Framework:
Langchain, a framework utilized in the project, enhances the development and 
deployment of language models. It provides tools and resources for building 
and managing language-based applications, streamlining the integration of 
language models into the system.
